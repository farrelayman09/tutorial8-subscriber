## Reflection
### a. what is amqp?
Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) is an open standard for passing business messages between applications or organizations. 
It connects systems, feeds business processes with the information they need and transmits onward the instructions that 
achieve their goals. 
### b. what it means? guest:guest@localhost:5672 , what is the first quest,and what is the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for?
guest:guest represents a user credential in the format username:password. Thus, the first guest is the username, 
and the second guest is the password. 
Port 5672 is the standard port used by the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), which is commonly associated with message 
brokers like RabbitMQ. If we're connecting to a RabbitMQ server, we'd typically use port 5672.
